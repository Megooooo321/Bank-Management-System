Bank Management System â€“ C++
A console-based banking application developed in C++ to simulate and manage core banking operations. The system is designed to store and retrieve client data using text files, ensuring data persistence without the need for a database.

Key Features:

Client Management: Add, edit, delete, and search for client accounts.

Authentication: Secure login system using account number and password verification.

Bank Transactions: Deposit and withdraw funds with validation for sufficient balance.

Financial Overview: Display total bank balances across all clients.

Data Persistence: All client data is stored in structured text files for easy retrieval.

User Interface: Menu-driven console interface for smooth navigation and user experience.

Technical Highlights:

C++ Fundamentals: Utilized structs, vectors, enums, and modular functions.

File Handling: Implemented robust reading/writing operations with error handling.

Code Organization: Clear separation of logic into functions for maintainability.

Input Validation: Prevented invalid or incomplete data entries.

Impact:
This project demonstrates strong understanding of procedural programming, file handling, and basic data management without relying on databases. It serves as a foundation for more advanced banking or management systems using object-oriented design and database integration.
